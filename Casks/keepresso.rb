# Homebrew Cask for Keepresso.
#
# This lives here as the source of truth. To make `brew install --cask keepresso`
# work, publish it to a tap repo named `gyorgysh/homebrew-keepresso` (a GitHub
# repo with this file under `Casks/`), after which:
#
#   brew install --cask gyorgysh/keepresso/keepresso
#
# Per release: bump `version` and set `sha256` to the DMG's hash
#   (shasum -a 256 dist/Keepresso-<version>.dmg), then commit to the tap.
# The `livecheck` block lets `brew livecheck` notice new GitHub releases.
